# Flockheart
Flocking simulation inspired by [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/). Boids are controlled by avoidance, cohesion, separation and alignment behaviours, in addition to seeking the red pill. 
Space fires red pill towards center of flock. Holding mouse button pans camera, and A-Z zooms in and out. C switches camera. Made in Unity.
